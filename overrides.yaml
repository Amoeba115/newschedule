# overrides.yaml
# Use this file to force specific employee assignments.
# The scheduler will treat these as "pinned" and will not change them.
# NOTE: The system does NOT validate these overrides against the rules.
# This is by design, to give you full control.


# - employee: Example E.
#   position: Handout
#   start_time: "9:00 AM"
#   end_time: "10:00 AM"
