# rules.yaml - Scheduling Rule Configuration
# This file defines the hard rules the scheduling engine MUST follow.

# --- Position-Specific Rules ---
# Define how many consecutive 30-minute time slots an employee can work in a specific role.
position_rules:
  - position: Conductor
    max_consecutive_slots: 2 # 1 hour
    # If true, a new Conductor can only start on the hour (e.g., 9:00), not the half-hour.
    must_start_on_the_hour: true

  - position: [Line Buster 1, Line Buster 2, Line Buster 3]
    # This prevents an employee from being a Line Buster for more than 30 minutes straight.
    max_consecutive_slots: 1

  - position: [Handout, Expo, Drink Maker 1, Drink Maker 2]
    # All other standard positions have a 1-hour limit.
    max_consecutive_slots: 2

# --- Algorithm Settings ---
# These are preferences the algorithm will try to follow after all hard rules are met.
preferences:
  # When assigning employees, prioritize giving roles to those who have been idle the longest.
  - prioritize_rested_employees: true
  # When possible, rotate employees through different positions to improve variety.
  - prefer_variety: true
